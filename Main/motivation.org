* What is motivation?
Motivation is a combination of many different factors, biological, psychological, neuroscientific, spiritual, and environmental factors all play a role in motivation.

The ancient yogis discovered that motivation is the ability to hold one thought persistently in the mind. The yogis called this a "concentrated mind" or a "one-pointed mind". When you become less motivated, there are different thoughts trickling into the mind, and you become less concentrated on it.
