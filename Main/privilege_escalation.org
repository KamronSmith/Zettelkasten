Usually when you gain access to a box you are a low privileged user, which just will not do. To gain higher privileges, you will need to find a local vulnerability to exploit.

* Common Methods
** PrivEsc checklists
** Enumeration Scripts
** Kernel exploits
** Vulnerable software
** User privileges
** Scheduled Tasks
** Exposed Credentials
** SSH keys
